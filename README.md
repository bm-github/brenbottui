As the project evolves, you may need to update this README to reflect new features, dependencies, or usage instructions.Here's an updated README.md content focusing on the Project Description, Installation, Usage, and Contributing sections:

## Project Description

BBot is a versatile text-based chatbot application that leverages AI capabilities from either Anthropic or OpenAI. It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with advanced language models, making it easy to integrate AI-powered conversations into various workflows.

Key features of BBot include:
- Flexible AI provider selection (Anthropic or OpenAI)
- Environment-based configuration
- Logging functionality
- Error handling and graceful fallback between providers
- Repository content scanning for dynamic README generation

The project is structured to be easily expandable and maintainable, with separate modules for different functionalities.

## Installation

To install BBot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bbot.git
   cd bbot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Optionally, set your preferred AI provider:
     ```
     AI_PROVIDER=anthropic  # or openai
     ```

## Usage

To use BBot, run the main script from the command line:

```
python main.py
```

You can then interact with the chatbot by typing your messages. The chatbot will respond using the configured AI provider.

Additional usage notes:
- The chatbot will use the AI provider specified in the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable, falling back to the alternative if the primary is unavailable.
- You can customize the file types scanned by the repository content analyzer by modifying the `file_types.json` configuration file.

# TextBasedChatBot

TextBasedChatBot is a versatile, command-line interface chatbot that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models or Anthropic's Claude model to engage in human-like conversations.

## Key Features

- Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic API providers
- Configurable system message to customize the chatbot's behavior
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Continuous conversation with memory of chat history
- Flexible model selection

[Your existing content here]

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Set up your API keys in `apifile.json`
3. Run `python chatbot.py`
4. Select your preferred API provider and model
5. Start chatting!

## Supported Models

- OpenAI: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 (subject to availability)
- Anthropic: Claude (latest version)

Each model has its own strengths. GPT models excel in general knowledge and language tasks, while Claude is known for its strong reasoning capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter API errors, ensure your API keys are correct and you have sufficient credits.
- For "Model not found" errors, check if you've selected a valid model for your chosen API.
- If the bot seems to "forget" previous messages, check your available tokens and consider using a model with a larger context window.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface
- Add support for more API providers
- Implement local model support for offline use
- Add conversation saving and loading features

As the project evolves, you may need to update this README to reflect new features, dependencies, or usage instructions.Here's an updated README.md content focusing on the Project Description, Installation, Usage, and Contributing sections:

## Project Description

BBot is a versatile text-based chatbot application that leverages AI capabilities from either Anthropic or OpenAI. It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with advanced language models, making it easy to integrate AI-powered conversations into various workflows.

Key features of BBot include:
- Flexible AI provider selection (Anthropic or OpenAI)
- Environment-based configuration
- Logging functionality
- Error handling and graceful fallback between providers
- Repository content scanning for dynamic README generation

The project is structured to be easily expandable and maintainable, with separate modules for different functionalities.

## Installation

To install BBot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bbot.git
   cd bbot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Optionally, set your preferred AI provider:
     ```
     AI_PROVIDER=anthropic  # or openai
     ```

## Usage

To use BBot, run the main script from the command line:

```
python main.py
```

You can then interact with the chatbot by typing your messages. The chatbot will respond using the configured AI provider.

Additional usage notes:
- The chatbot will use the AI provider specified in the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable, falling back to the alternative if the primary is unavailable.
- You can customize the file types scanned by the repository content analyzer by modifying the `file_types.json` configuration file.

# TextBasedChatBot

TextBasedChatBot is a versatile, command-line interface chatbot that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models or Anthropic's Claude model to engage in human-like conversations.

## Key Features

- Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic API providers
- Configurable system message to customize the chatbot's behavior
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Continuous conversation with memory of chat history
- Flexible model selection

[Your existing content here]

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Set up your API keys in `apifile.json`
3. Run `python chatbot.py`
4. Select your preferred API provider and model
5. Start chatting!

## Supported Models

- OpenAI: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 (subject to availability)
- Anthropic: Claude (latest version)

Each model has its own strengths. GPT models excel in general knowledge and language tasks, while Claude is known for its strong reasoning capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter API errors, ensure your API keys are correct and you have sufficient credits.
- For "Model not found" errors, check if you've selected a valid model for your chosen API.
- If the bot seems to "forget" previous messages, check your available tokens and consider using a model with a larger context window.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface
- Add support for more API providers
- Implement local model support for offline use
- Add conversation saving and loading features
